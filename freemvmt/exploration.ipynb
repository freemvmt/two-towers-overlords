      "Conclusions: In adult body CT, dose to an organ fully encompassed by the primary radiation beam can be estimated from CTDI vol using a protocol-independent conversion coefficient. However, fully encompassed organs only account for 50% ± 19% of k factor and 46% ± 24% of q factor. Dose received by partially encompassed organs is also substantial. To estimate effective dose and risk index from DLP, it is necessary to use conversion coefficients specific to the anatomical region examined.\n",
